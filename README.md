# full-alphabe

Set of commands that attempt to answer the following question:

> Is there a set of five english words of length five which are mutually distinct?

Or, put differently, can we come up with five english words which use all but 1 letter of the alphabet?

This was solved by [Matt Parker on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w&list=WL), and then solved more effeciently by a viewer.

This solution is based off of the verbal description of the solution submitted by the viewer of that channel.
